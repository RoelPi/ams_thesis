``\ldots definitions of management consultancy are problematic because
the permeable boundaries of the industry have resulted in significant
shifts over time in the composition of the industry. This means that
what comprises consulting work is dynamic, ever shifting, and contested
as new firms enter the industry and techniques deemed formerly
appropriate, change. Although the industry is characterized by periodic
structural shifts, at its heart it is an advisory activity built on the
client--consultant relationship. {[}\ldots{]} it is perhaps this
chimeral ability to avoid precise definition and to be able to
constantly reinvent its core services to meet ever changing
understandings of the problems that beset contemporary organizations,
which partly underpins its growing economic importance.'' \citep[
24]{kipping2012}

\citet[1]{werr1997} implies that there is always a change process
between clients and consultants.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Vague body of knowledge: Consulting knowledge is described as elusive,
  fuzzy, perishable, indeterminate, esoteric, fluid and changeable
  \citep{muzio2011}.
\item
  Weak professionalization: Consultancy is marked by very low
  professionalization. Occupational entry is unprotected, the supply of
  labor is not regulated and there is no formal accreditation. \citep[
  20]{fincham2006} Practising ``consultancy'' is the main criterion of
  membership. Competences and `time spent in the industry' are the main
  differentiators.
\item
  Market-based orientation: ``The top client firms in any given sector
  represent the cornerstone of consultants' ability to benchmark
  leading-edge knowledge.'' \citep[ 24]{fincham2006}
\item
  Nicknames: they belong to the cultural circuits of capitalism \citep[
  95]{thrift2005}, capitalism's commissars \citep[ 93]{thrift2005},
  ``shadowy figures operating in the background but exercising
  considerable influence.'' \citep[ 31]{kipping2012}, ``agents of a
  modern rationalistic and universalistic culture'' \citep[
  190]{kipping2012}, ``institutionally approved agents'' \citep[
  193]{kipping2012}
\item
  Management consultancies earn money through changing current
  procedures in client organizations. \citep[ 12]{kipping2000}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{it-consultancy}{%
\paragraph{IT Consultancy}\label{it-consultancy}}

\citet[71-72]{armbruster2006} argues that the boundaries between
consultancy service types are blurred. A single project often requires
multiple types of services, but the distinction is often artificial.
Especially the boundary between strategy and IT consultancy is opaque
due to the fact that the big accounting \& strategy firms entered the IT
consultancy market to conduct all-encompassing projects where strategy
and IT meet.

\paragraph{Outsourcing}\label{outsourcing}}

Outsourcing is the practice of obtaining goods or services from an
external provider, as a substitute for sourcing it internally \citep[
2]{lacity2012}. Although \citet[68-69]{willcocks1995} focuses
specifically on IT outsourcing (infra), most outsourcing arrangements
can be located on four spectra: * Focus: control through contract
vis-à-vis results through trust and partnership * Time-scale: short-term
vis-à-vis long-term * Criticality of the relationship: low vis-à-vis
high * Mindset: contract out vis-à-vis strategic alliance

According to \citet[255]{liberatore2010} consulting differs from
outsourcing with respect to two dimensions: (1) the client and the
consulting organization may have conflicting goals and incompatible work
practices. Despite these differences (2) client and consultant need to
collaborate throughout the project.

Definition at \citet[67]{willcocks1995}.

According to \citet[70-71]{willcocks1995}, ``the difference in mind-set
that is often thought to be required as IT outsourcing decisions become
more `total' in their coverage, has many similarities to the espoused
need for mind-set changes for managers working in long-term strategic
alliances.''

Furthermore, since working with consultants holds a risk of moral hazard
(infra), maintenance and enforcement are aspects that need to be taken
into account. Typically, total outsourcing relations don't rely on trust
mechanisms solely and are accompanied by contractual governance
measures.

Total outsourcing entails some risks (\citet{willcocks1995} 77).
Organizations need to be wary of the balance shifting in favor of the
vendor, unless clients maintain some countervailing leverages to support
the basis of their partnership.

\subsubsection{Why digital consultancy? A practical
perspective}\label{why-digital-consultancy-a-practical-perspective}}

\citet{turner1982} provides a hierarchy of consulting purposes. The
first five are traditionally associated with consultancy, while the last
three are seen as by-products, and often not as explicit goals.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Provide requested information
\item
  Provide solution to given problem
\item
  Conduct diagnosis that may redefine problem
\item
  Provide recommendations
\item
  Assist implementation. This is not without controversy, as
  traditionally, some argued that ``one who helps put recommendations
  into effect takes on the role of manager and thus exceeds consulting's
  legitimate bounds.'' Also, ``a frequent dilemma for experienced
  consultants is whether they should recommend what they know is right
  or what they know will be accepted.''
\item
  Build consensus and commitment
\item
  Facilitate client learning
\item
  Improve organizational effectiveness
\end{enumerate}

If we go from consultancy, in general, to IT consultancy, it is
essential to understand that over the past decades, their possible roles
and variety of responsibilities have expanded drastically.
\citet[20-25]{swanson2010} has described five different ways how
consultants can contribute to an organization's innovation process
through IT.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Business strategy}: IT consultancy can lead the organization to
  new pursuits and technologies they wouldn't have discovered
  themselves. Second, IT consultancy can frame the need for innovation
  in strategic terms, and they prepare and legitimize the need for
  change.
\item
  \emph{Technology assessment}: IT consultancy can facilitate the
  comprehension of IT technologies and its alternatives.
\item
  \emph{Business process improvement}: Innovations that involve IT
  usually come to fruition only after business processes have been
  revamped. Business process changes usually require an outside-in view
  and offer rich opportunities for consulting.
\item
  \emph{Systems integration}: In many cases, introducing a new
  technology requires that it needs to be integrated with existing
  systems and users need to be onboarded. This type of IT consultancy
  usually requires coding skills, hands-on design and implementation
  expertise
\item
  \emph{Business support services}: Finally, once the implementation is
  completed, it can take a while before the solution is entirely
  assimilated. IT consultants can provide complementary IT services such
  as support and maintenance until the technology is entirely embedded
  in the organization.
\end{itemize}

In their 1994 study, for which they interviewed over 100 decision,
\citet[10-17]{lacity1994} group expectations with regards to outsourcing
into four categories: financial, business, technical and political
expectations.

\hypertarget{financial-expectations}{%

\paragraph{Knowledge transfer \&
diffusion}\label{knowledge-transfer-diffusion}}

Return to \citet{turner1982}.

Something about knowledge transfer here \citep{sturdy2009}.

Nevertheless, there are constraints to knowledge transfer. According to
\citet[128-129]{cohen1990}, ``the ability to evaluate and utilize
outside knowledge is largely a function of the level of prior related
knowledge {[}such as{]} basic skills, or even a shared language but may
also include knowledge of the most recent scientific or technological
developments in a given field. {[}\ldots{]} These abilities collectively
constitute what we call a firm's \emph{absorptive capacity}.''

There is substantial research on knowledge management (as a
multidisciplinary discipline within the field of information science)
and knowledge transfer (as a broad topic within the discipline).
Furthermore, there seems to be some academic interest in knowledge
transfer in a principal-agent context \citep{ning2008, haines2003}, as
is the case with between an organization and their contingent workforce.
This research could be key in steering and narrowing the scope of the
research.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{why-digital-consultancy-a-theoretical-perspective}{%
\subsection{Why digital Consultancy: a theoretical
perspective}\label{why-digital-consultancy-a-theoretical-perspective}}

According to \citet[3-6]{armbruster2006}, the theoretical perspectives
on consultancy can be broken down into two main categories and
corresponding streams of literature. The first one is the functionalist
view, which sees consultants as ``carriers and transmitters of
management knowledge.'' The second perspective argues that the
functionalist perspective is to narrow in scope to grasp consulting
projects: client-consultants interactions are open to distortions, and
understanding them requires research. This is known as the critical
view.

\hypertarget{transaction-cost-economics}{%
\subsubsection{Transaction cost
economics}\label{transaction-cost-economics}}

Transaction costs economics sees economic organization as a problem of
contracting, i.e.~organizing economic activity. The starting point is
that every transaction comes with certain costs, both ex ante and ex
post. Ex ante transaction costs come in the form of drafting and
negotiating an agreement, which can become extremely complex when lots
of contingencies are present. Ex post transaction costs, on the other
hand, include maladaptation costs, when the delivery of a good or
service drifts from its initial conceptualization, the haggling costs
for adapting the contract, the setup and running of governance
structures to handle disputes and finally and recurring bonding costs to
secure commitments.

Their bounded rationality makes it impossible for humans to estimate
both the costs and risks of complete contracts, or even enacting and
enforcing them. \citep[ 53]{aubert1996} The result is that the
contractual partners often decide to leave room for adaptation and
interpretation, which, in turn, increases the risk of opportunistic
behavior (infra).

According to transaction cost economics, the decision whether a service
should be conducted in-house or purchased in the market is based on the
comparison of the sum of production and transaction costs \citep[
12]{armbruster2006}.

\citet[31]{canback1998} does a solid job explaining the role of
transaction costs in explaining the raison d'être of consultants. ``As
companies strive to reduce the production costs by exploiting scale and
scope economies, they must specialise -- which in turn leads to a need
for internal coordination. If transaction costs did not exist, then the
largest company in each market would also be the most profitable
company, since coordination between functions could be achieved without
effort. But because of transaction costs, this does not happen.'' The
result is that blue-collar jobs disappear as production costs are
reduced, while white-collar jobs, aimed at coordination, do not.

Mindful of this evolution, the assumption is that there is a high demand
for advice and (IT) solutions that improve coordination within and
between firms. These are services in which consultants are particularly
well-versed. The question to ask here is: are the transaction costs for
working with external consultants lower than for working with internal
consultants when it comes to knowledge production?

\citet[37-44]{canback1998} argues it does, and arguments from the three
critical dimensions of transactions, a popular research topic within
transaction cost economics.

\emph{Asset specificity} describes the degree to which physical, human
or site assets have a specific usage and can they not be put to use for
another purpose. With highly idiosyncratic transactions, no vendor is
willing to tailor his product or service to one client, and face
downward price pressure, since the latter acts as a monopsonist \citep[
218-228]{robinson1969}.

According to \citet[250-253]{williamson1979} higher asset specificity
leads either to one of two forms of ``relational contracting''. The
first form is bilateral governance in which there are ``admissible
dimensions for adjustment such that flexibility is provided under terms
in which both parties have confidence.'' The second form is unified
governance (i.e.~internalization or vertical integration), in which
``adaptations can be made in a sequential way without the need to
consult, complete, or revise interfirm agreements. Where a single
ownership entity spans both sides of the transactions, a presumption of
joint profit maximization is waranted.''

\citet[95-96]{williamson1985} identifies 4 types of asset specificity:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Site specificity: the degree to which the successive stages of
  production are in close proximity to each other.
\item
  Physical asset specificity: the degree to which the physical
  properties of the product are unique.
\item
  Human asset specificity: the degree to which the skills, or
  configuration of skills within a team, are unique to an organization's
  production process.
\item
  Dedicated assets: ???
\end{enumerate}

The second dimension is the \emph{frequency} of transactions on the
buyer side. A transaction with high asset specificity does not require a
different contracting approach, because there is no subsequent phase in
which the buyer can leverage his monopsony power and stray from the
initial contract. However, when the frequency goes beyond a single
transaction ``idiosyncratic transactions are ones for which the
relationship between buyer and supplier is quickly thereafter
transformed into one of bilateral monopoly.'' \citep[
241]{williamson1985}

\emph{Uncertainty}. Within the context of transaction cost economics,
\citet[38]{shin2003} states that ``many empirical studies show mixed and
contradictory results against what transaction cost economics predicts,
especially for the concept of uncertainty.'' and as a solution, reduces
the concept to ``behavioral uncertainty'', hereby ignoring environmental
uncertainty \citep[ 391-392]{watjatrakul2005} This is in line with
\citet[79]{williamson1985} who claims that ``The proposed match of
governance structures with transactions considers only two of the three
dimensions for describing transactions: asset specificity and frequency.
The third dimension, uncertainty, is assumed to be present in sufficient
degree to pose an adaptive, sequential decision problem. {[}\ldots{]}
Since continuity now matters, {[}\ldots{]} uncertainty makes it more
imperative to organize transactions within governance structures that
have the capacity to `work things out.'\,''

When we bring these three dimensions together, we conclude that
behavioral uncertainty arises from asset specificity because it may lead
to opportunism, but only in recurrent transactions. In this context,
behavioral uncertainty and can't be disentangled from asset specificity.
\citet[78]{williamson1985} is fully aware that this is a departure from
Coase's transaction cost rationale.

To drive back the theory to the subject of consulting,
\citet[37]{canback1998} argues that it's mainly human asset specificity
that favor using consultants, since their assignments typically have a
low human asset specificity so that the solution or advice can be
reproduced at many organizations.\footnote{Furthermore, Canback claims
  that transaction frequency and uncertainty are less of an influence.
  By referring to market uncertainty, not only does he obscure the fact
  that consultants rather thrive in a context with high complexity and
  uncertainty, he also misrepresents the uncertainty dimension that is
  central in transaction cost economics. This is a prime example of the
  vagueness surrounding the concept of uncertainty in transaction cost
  economics (supra).} \citet[408]{watjatrakul2005} put the theory to the
test and compared the transaction cost view with the resource-based view
(infra) for describing the sourcing decisions in three cases and comes
to the following conclusion: ``a high-specificity asset has a major
impact on sourcing decisions. It overpowers the effect of uncertainty.''

Focusing on low-specificity assets allows consultancy firms to achieve
economies of scale. That's why they rather shun highly idiosyncratic
assignments. Rather, they'll focus on (often high-level) organizational
advice and IT architectures, since these have the biggest adaptive
properties.

Borrowing rhetoric from the resource-based view (infra)
\citet[498]{mata1995} applies Canback's conclusion on technical IT
skills: ``While technical skills are essential in the use and
application of IT, they are usually not sources of sustained competitive
advantage. {[}\ldots{]} they are usually not heterogeneously distributed
across firms. Moreover, even when they are heterogeneously distributed
across firms, they are typically highly mobile. {[}\ldots{]} firms
without the required analysis, design, and programming skills required
to make an IT investment can hire technical consultants and
contractors.'' Ergo, IT capabilities are very likely to be outsourced.

\citet[16-17]{nevo2007} also concludes that his research supports the
transaction cost hypothesis: ``when the internal IT capability is weak,
developing and implementing an IT solution is likely to cost more
compared with hiring external IT consultants to do the same
job.''\footnote{ the reverse situation also supports the identification
  theory: ``IT consultants will not receive the legitimacy they require
  {[}\ldots{]} if their knowledge and expertise do not differ from that
  possessed by the in-house IT team. Under these circumstances, external
  IT consultants' impact on IT productivity is expected to be lower.''}

\hypertarget{agency-theory}{%
\subsubsection{Agency Theory}\label{agency-theory}}

Agency theory is very compatible with transaction cost economics. When
an organization decides to not develop a specific service in-house, and
instead, buys it in the market, it encounters agency issues: information
asymmetries and goal incompatibility. See \citet{shapiro2005}. The
organization is interested in a timely roll-out of a quality solution
for a problem they have. The consultancy firm, on the other hand, is
driven by profit maximization.

\hypertarget{resource-based-view}{%
\subsubsection{Resource-based View}\label{resource-based-view}}

The resource-based view rejects the traditional microeconomic
assumptions that goods or services are homogeneous. Instead, it argues
that they are heterogeneously distributed across firms, and not
perfectly transferable \citet[392]{watjatrakul2005}. These resources
come in the form of assets, capabilities or organizational processes.
Firms can obtain above-normal results if they can establish a
competitive advantage by making their resources to exploit opportunities
in the market, or neutralize those established by competitors. To be
strategic, resources should be valuable, rare, inimitable and
non-substitutable.

In \citet[177-180]{willcocks2003}, four types of sourcing options for
developing IT projects are outlined, of which three involve consultants.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Internal development: has the the advantage of internalization of the
  learning outcomes, but comes with high costs related to mistakes and
  being the first mover.
\item
  Outsourcing: has the advantage of tapping into existing knowledge and
  experience, and the ability to get quickly up to speed. However,
  internalization of learning outcomes is not guaranteed, and
  consultants may not be familiar with existing organizational
  processes. For example, the development of an internal application by
  an external party.
\item
  Insourcing/partnering: has the same advantages as outsourcing, with
  the added bonus of facilitating the internalization of the learning
  outcomes. The disadvantage is mostly related to a more complex project
  management, with a variety of parties involved. For example: long-term
  contracts with IT consultants who operate side-by-side with an
  organization's own staff.
\item
  Cheap-sourcing: when IT projects are low risk, and far from the core
  business, and organization should consider cheap-sourcing. This option
  involves low investments and effort, but also comes with no internal
  learning. For example: development of a new promotional website by a
  digital agency.
\end{enumerate}

In the same research paper, \citet[188-189]{willcocks2003} identify two
congruent four-quadrant matrices to assess sourcing options.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  By business activity: non-critical, commoditized applications should
  be out-sourced. Critical, commoditized applications should be
  insourced or built in-house, and differentiating, critical
  applications should be built in-house or acquired.
\item
  By market comparison: A high-cost, low-quality market leads to
  in-house development, while a high-cost, high-quality market should
  lead to insourcing. A low-cost, low-quality market leads to
  cheap-sourcing and a low-cost, high-quality market is perfect for
  outsourcing.
\end{itemize}

By referring to commoditization, \citet{willcocks2003} implicitly refers
to asset specificity, blending elements of transaction cost economics in
the resource based view. \citet{watjatrakul2005} does this explicitly by
juxtaposing the resource-based view with the transaction cost view. Four
types of assets result from this exercise:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Low specificity, non-strategic such as generic managerial
  capabilities.
\item
  Low specificity, strategic such as a configuration of capabilities
  that result in certain strategic decisions.
\item
  High specificity, non-strategic such as an consumer tracking
  technology that provides valuable insights into the organization's
  processes.
\item
  High specificity, strategic such as company experts that are
  responsible for developing a organization's differentiating features.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{identification-theory}{%
\subsubsection{Identification Theory}\label{identification-theory}}

The research by \citet[311-313]{schwarz2005} claims that it matters
\emph{who} implements an IT project: ``technology-enabled inertia can be
explained through understanding an employee's social identifications and
his or her associated cognitions, where inertia exists on a sliding
scale of change.'' By defending their self-image, low-status groups can
hinder the implementation of an application. The sourcing assessment
needs to incorporate this finding.

``\ldots competitive pressures, on both clients and consultants,
combined with a US culture of anti-intellectualism and `macho' (grand
and unreflective) visions lead to the marketing and adoption of
simplistic and necessarily flawed techniques.'' \citep[ 34]{sturdy1998}

``Terms such as `growth' and `effectiveness' have mythical qualities.
They are condensation symbols collapsing a managerial world view into a
single word. So, too, {[}\ldots{]} consultancy packages {[}make{]} use
of condensation symbols thereby creating affective bonds to the symbol's
object, tying managers into the package at an emotional level and
creating a shared managerial language.'' \citep[ 290]{gill1993}

\hypertarget{embeddedness-theory}{%
\subsubsection{Embeddedness Theory}\label{embeddedness-theory}}

Embeddedness theorists distance themselves from transaction costs
economics \citep[ 14-16]{armbruster2006}. They argue that outsourcing
decisions are the byproduct of the relationships between the
decision-makers across different companies. Although transaction cost
economists stress the importance of trust within relational contracting,
it is undersocialized according to embeddedness theorists. ``As a
result, transactions may be inefficient without the participants either
noticing or calculating it as such. A transaction cost analysis of such
processes may then represent an ex post rationalization of an otherwise
inefficient solution.'' \citep[ 15]{armbruster2006}

Several empirical findings support embeddedness theory.

\hypertarget{sociological-neoinstitutionalism}{%
\subsubsection{Sociological
neoinstitutionalism}\label{sociological-neoinstitutionalism}}

A theory that is systematically drawn upon \citep[ 6-8]{armbruster2006}
is sociological neoinstitutionalism. It is based on the argument that
the belief in efficiency of certain practices or solutions drives
economic actions, rather than the proven efficiency. The result is that
large consultancies have been described as carriers, not only of
knowledge, but of legitimacy too. After all, it's their analyses that
validate management decisions.

\citet[20-21]{zucker1985} argues that this is the result of
trust-building signals (infra) growing beyond their initial goal of
delineating specific expectations. Trust-producing firms (such as
consultancy firms) an sich assume a high status, with the business world
protecting them against failure.

Clearly, this view is mainly appropriated by the critical view since it
raises doubts about the efficient outcomes on the practice of
consultancy.

\hypertarget{signaling-theory}{%
\subsubsection{Signaling Theory}\label{signaling-theory}}

Another theory that falls in the camp of the critical view is that of
economic signaling theory \citep[ 8-10]{armbruster2006}. Unlike
sociological institutionalism, it treats the economic actors as
experienced and knowledgeable, and not as part of an institution.
Signaling theory argues that in uncertain markets, suppliers invest in
features that signal status, quality and reliability.

\citet[15-16]{zucker1985} argues that these features can also be used to
signal similarity. While nationality, ethnicity and sex can indicate a
common cultural system, or a ``world held in common'', more superficial
(bought or acquired) features can delineate specific expectations in
specific situations. In consulting this translates into degrees,
certificates, using the adequate buzzwords, wearing a suit and driving a
quality car. These indicators signal adherence to the ``rules of the
game.''

Sociological neoinstitutionalism argues that legitimacy-seeking behavior
leads to inefficient market outcomes, while signaling theory argues the
opposite.

\hypertarget{problem-statement}{%
\section{Problem statement}\label{problem-statement}}

Organizations employing the services of a contingent workforce, like
digital consultants, should always be aware of principal-agent problems
arising from information asymmetries. This is caused by the fact that a
transaction between a vendor and a buying organization involves the
delivery of services in the future. As a result, opportunism is always
lurking around the corner.

Two types of opportunism can be identified \citet[242]{clark1993}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Ex ante: Pre-contractual opportunism or adverse selection
\item
  Ex post: Post-contractual opportunism or moral hazard
\end{enumerate}

Hiring consultants for digital services deserves a dedicated scope,
because of the following five properties that make it very prone to
opportunism \citep[ 207]{leslie1995}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Information technology evolves rapidly. Consequently, it involves a
  high degree of uncertainty. (ex ante)
\item
  The underlying economics of IT changes rapidly, making it hard to
  evaluate the consultant's contribution. (ex post)
\item
  IT has penetrated all business functions. It is hard to isolate it
  from organizational functions. The question is rarely about
  ``outsourcing or not'', but more often about ``what tasks will be
  outsourced, and how''. The result is that the responsibilities of
  in-house staff and consultants is very intertwined. (ex post)
\item
  The cost of switching providers are often significant. For example:
  some consultants have exclusivity for implementing a certain solution.
  (ex post)
\item
  Clients might be very inexperienced with regards to IT (and
  outsourcing it). This puts them at a disadvantage for selecting and
  evaluating a consultant (ex ante, ex post).
\end{enumerate}

\citet[59]{aubert1996} also points to a problem of measurement within IT
outsourcing. Contracts often specify all kinds of measures: response
time, uptime, error logs, etc. Although they are linked to explicit
provisions (such as fines, penalties and contract termination), there
are two conditions for them to be effective: (1) observability and (2)
verifiability. The former implies that the client can observe the actual
performance of the agent, while the latter is about verifying
observations and providing evidence.

\hypertarget{adverse-selection}{%
\subsection{Adverse Selection}\label{adverse-selection}}

Adverse selection is associated with the client's inability to determine
the client's capabilities with regards to the assignment. This analogous
to Akerlof's ``Lemons problem'' \citeyearpar{akerlof1970}: due to the
information asymmetry, clients don't want to pay more than the average
price for consultants within a certain niche. While consultants of
below-average quality (``lemons'') benefit from this average price,
above-average consultants will not want to compete, and are crowded out.

\citep[ 69-75]{armbruster2006} outlines various reasons for quality
uncertainty and groups them in two categories.

Category 1: Formal institutional uncertainty

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consulting is an unbounded profession.
\item
  Consulting is an unbounded industry.
\item
  Consulting has unbounded service lines and product standards.
\end{itemize}

Category 2: Transactional Uncertainty

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Confidentiality
\item
  Product intangibility
\item
  Interdependent cooperation
\end{itemize}

The economic barriers to entry \citep[ 463]{fee2004} in IT consultancy
(and consultancy in general) are few to none. Anyone with experience in
a specific field, sector or technology can wrap it as advice and sell it
to whoever wants to hear it. Furthermore, the author of this paper is
unaware of legal barriers to entry.

According to some, assessing the quality of consultants is impossible.
For example, according do \citet[40]{bloomfield1995}, ``there can be no
presumed separation between technical skills and political skills, and
no ranking between the two in terms of their importance for consultancy
practice and the development of IT in user organizations.'' Furthermore,
\citet[101-102]{bettencourt2002} states that for knowledge-intensive
business services (KIBS) to succeed, a lot depends on the client.
``Client co-production roles {[}\ldots{]} are emergent, multi-faceted,
and highly collaborative because clients themselves possess much of the
knowledge and competence that a KIBS firm needs to successfully deliver
its service solution.''

For evaluating (future) performance of consultants, one has to rely on
informal and relational criteria \citep[ 277]{wright2002}. According to
\citet[250]{clark1993}, ``the main trust-producing mechanism
{[}\ldots{]} is the `closed' social structure; a form of individual
trust. The formal, institutional-based, trust-producing mechanisms are
weak. It is the contractual guarantees, and the history of past
transactions underlying reputation, which overcome the potential effects
of adverse selection and moral hazard.''

Especially in a situation where past transactions are absent,
``management consultancies must convey in some way to their clients that
they have something valuable to offer. {[}\ldots{]} consultants are able
to take control of the process by which impressions and perceptions of
their service are created. By managing the creation of these images
consultants are able to persuade clients of their value and quality.
Management consultancies are therefore `systems of persuasion' \emph{par
excellence} and impression management is not external to the core of
their work but is at its core.'' \citep[ 35]{clark1998}

In the existing literature, these remarks are part of a critical
paradigm regarding consultants \citep[ 4-5]{armbruster2006}. Authors
point to the contestable nature of consulting, the self-interest of
consultancy firms, and the stretching of consultancy advice.

\hypertarget{governance-measures}{%
\subsection{Governance Measures}\label{governance-measures}}

Several mechanisms have already been proposed. What they all share is
that they should result in a higher degree of trust\footnote{Trust is
  defined in the broad sense: ``a set of expectations shared by all
  those involved in the an exchange.'' \citep[ 2]{zucker1985}} between
the business partners. More specific, trust from the principal towards
the agent. \citet[265]{liberatore2010} found that building trust, and
goal congruence, can help solve the agency problem because it drives the
consultancy firm's motivation for short-term profits towards long-term
business and reputation.

\hypertarget{psychological-contract-obligations}{%
\subsubsection{Psychological contract
obligations}\label{psychological-contract-obligations}}

According to \citet[357]{ang2004}, the legal interpretation of an IT
outsourcing contract is too limited. Instead, they claim that the
construct of a \emph{psychological contract} is more appropriate for
analyzing the relationship between an IT service supplier and customer.
The strength of psychological contract theory is threefold:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  it focuses on mutual obligations;
\item
  the emphasis is on psychological obligations;
\item
  the emphasis is on the individual level--not on the organizations as
  parties of the contract.
\end{enumerate}

Consequently, the psychological contract not only comprises the legal
contract, but also the unwritten promises, interpersonal relations, and
the individual interpretations and perceptions. Since consultancy
contracts can become extremely complex (with project descriptions going
into the ten thousands of words), and the involved parties entangled in
multiple ways, these intangible aspects can gain prominence. The
research in \citet[369-70]{ang2004} outlines several psychological
contract obligations that positively impact the success of an outsourced
IT project.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On the supplier side: (1) clear authority structures, (2) knowledge
  transfer by educating the customer, (3) building inter-organizational
  teams.
\item
  On the customer side: (1) clear specification of requirements, (2)
  prompt payment, and (3) project ownership and monitoring.
\end{itemize}

Closely related is the work by \citet[9-13]{willcockskern} that makes a
distinction between the contractual level and the cooperative level. The
contractual level is about payment for the exchange of services and the
transfer of assets, information \& consultants. The cooperative level
involves formal communication mechanisms; personal investments in time,
resources \& knowledge; mutual goals \& objectives and social bonds. The
atmosphere surrounding the former is heavily impacted by developments at
the latter. A respondent in \citet[9]{willcockskern} states that ``the
contract is a bit like a nuclear deterrent. You need one and you have
got to have a framework, but if you've got to use it you are probably in
trouble.''

\hypertarget{reputation}{%
\subsubsection{Reputation}\label{reputation}}

\citet[75-76]{armbruster2006} distinguishes three types of reputation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Public reputation is the perception of a consulting firm's (or
  individual consultant) past performance. While there are few to no
  barriers to enter the market as a whole with a newly-found consulting
  firm, public reputation is a huge barrier to reaching its upper end.
  Public reputation is like a public good ; the information is
  non-excludable and non-rivalrous.
\item
  Experience-based trust relates to personal experience with a specific
  partner. A positive relation drives future action. However, trust
  evolves slowly, and maintaining it requires commitment. That's why it
  is often constrained to a small group of business partners.
\item
  Networked reputation is the result of word-of-mouth recommendations
\end{enumerate}

\citet[243-244]{clark1993} asked 55 respondents about the factors that
are important when choosing an executive search \& selection
consultancy. ``Reputation of individual consultants'' and ``reputation
of the consultancy'' are in the top three factors. This reputation often
arises from ``a history of past transactions with individual
consultants. Frequent transactions between consultants and clients leads
to familiarity which underpins the latters' assessment of the former.''
In other words, because finding a new consultants implies a search cost
\citep[ 1072]{wilson2012}, incumbent consultants are expected to receive
new contracts as long as the cost incurred from a potential sub-optimal
performance is lower than the search cost of finding a new consultant.

According to \citet[516]{nayyar1990} ``reputation performs as an
implicit contract. It is enforced by the seller's concerns about future
demand for the service provided. {[}\ldots{]} reputation is likely to
exhibit characteristics of a public good. Once acquired, it can be user
over and over again in the context of other services or markets.''

\paragraph{Contractual Obligations}\label{contractual-obligations}}

\citet{mcfarlan1995} claim that it is important to have flexibility in
an outsourcing contract, because the target state of a project might
change due to evolving technology and business environment.
Nevertheless\ldots{}

\citet[4]{lacity2012} describes that there is substantial evidence that
positive outsourcing outcomes are associated with:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  more detailed contracts with regards to scope, service levels,
  responsibilities and adaption to change;
\item
  shorter-term contracts;
\item
  high-value contracts.
\end{itemize}

More detailed contracts, when resulting in requirements uncertainty, is
an enabler of goal congruence and trust between the consultancy firm and
the client, which is found to result in a better project performance
\citep{liberatore264}.

a variety of situations: stock brokers, real estate agents, banks, etc.
The same principle can be applied to consultants: assessment by a
third-party agency can prevent adverse selection.

When there are no trust-related nor legal enforcement mechanisms,
parties can be discouraged from forming long-term relationships.
According to \citet[47-48]{werner1993}, ``hostages'' are used in
situations where rational behavior would lead to sub-optimal outcome, in
the Paretoian sense. In game theoretical terms, hostage-taking is used
to prevent defecting behavior.

In terms of the subject of this paper, ``hostages'' could come in the
form of contingent fees. See \citep[ 243]{clark1993}
