Traditionally, management consultancy came in the form of strategic
advice. However, over the past decades, the business world has witnessed
that organizations increasingly focus on their core business, while
outsourcing everything else to a third party or a ``contingent
workforce'': consultants and freelancers \citep{msp2022}. This practice
has even penetrated organizations' core value chain, a phenomenon known
as business process outsourcing or BPO \citep{shi1}. However, working
with a contingent workforce, entails considerable risk.

\subsubsection{Types of IT consultancy}\label{types-of-it-consultancy}}

Defining IT consultancy is no easy task. Over the past decades, their
possible roles and variety of responsibilities have expanded
drastically. \citet[20-25]{swanson2010} has described five different
ways how consultants can contribute to an organization's innovation
process through IT.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Business strategy}: IT consultancy can lead the organization to
  new pursuits and technologies they wouldn't have discovered
  themselves. Second, IT consultancy can frame the need for innovation
  in strategic terms, and they prepare and legitimize the need for
  change.
\item
  \emph{Technology assessment}: IT consultancy can facilitate the
  comprehension of IT technologies and its alternatives.
\item
  \emph{Business process improvement}: Innovations that involve IT
  usually come to fruition only after business processes have been
  revamped. Business process changes usually require an outside-in view
  and offer rich opportunities for consulting.
\item
  \emph{Systems integration}: In many cases, introducing a new
  technology requires that it needs to be integrated with existing
  systems and users need to be onboarded. This type of IT consultancy
  usually requires coding skills, hands-on design and implementation
  expertise
\item
  \emph{Business support services}: Finally, once the implementation is
  completed, it can take a while before the solution is entirely
  assimilated. IT consultants can provide complementary IT services such
  as support and maintenance until the technology is entirely embedded
  in the organization.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{knowledge-transfer}{%
\paragraph{Knowledge transfer}\label{knowledge-transfer}}

There is substantial research on knowledge management (as a
multidisciplinary discipline within the field of information science)
and knowledge transfer (as a broad topic within the discipline).
Furthermore, there seems to be some academic interest in knowledge
transfer in a principal-agent context \citep{ning2008, haines2003}, as
is the case with between an organization and their contingent workforce.
This research could be key in steering and narrowing the scope of the
research.

\hypertarget{link-with-management-consultancy}{%
\subsubsection{Link with Management
Consultancy}\label{link-with-management-consultancy}}

There is already a fair amount of research with regards to management
consultancy (i.e.~in the narrow sense of the term, meaning ``strategic
business advice'') that describes why consultants exist
\citep{canback1998, sturdy2009} and how they operate
\citep{clark1998, bessant1995, whittle2006}. Central in this literature
is the diffusion and transferring of knowledge. \citet{canback1999}
summarizes it neatly by stating that ``external consultants have a wider
knowledge base than their internal counterparts, having worked with more
clients and in a wider range of industries. Having seen similar problems
before, the cost of leveraging this knowledge base is lower for external
consultants.'' Despite this body of literature on management
consultancy, research that focuses on IT-related consultancy is fairly
scarce \citep{bloomfield1995, nevo2007, swanson2010}.

\hypertarget{why-it-consultancy}{%
\subsection{Why IT Consultancy?}\label{why-it-consultancy}}

\textless Unsure if this part should be expanded, or even in the final
paper\textgreater{} \citet[8-10]{nevo2007} outlines five theoretical
frameworks that contribute to the question why firms should (not)
utilize external IT capabilities.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \emph{resource-based view} (RBV) claims that firms can earn
  sustainable above-normal returns by possessing rare and valuable
  resources and that they have isolating mechanisms that prevent the
  dissemination of those resources.
\item
  The \emph{micro-economic} view assumes that firms operate in fully
  competitive markets and, contrary to RBV, that above-normal returns
  are competed away by rivals or new entrants. Utilizing IT and external
  capabilities is simply a matter of delivering the optimal quantity of
  products and their prices.
\item
  \emph{Transaction cost economics} claims that firms are interested in
  identifying areas in which they can outperform market-based
  interactions and do themselves. The commodity-like nature of IT
  solutions make them very prone to being outsourced to consultants.
\item
  \emph{Institutional theory} does not reject the micro-economic theory
  that firms try to make rational choices, but acknowledges that there
  are cognitive and rational constraints. Consequently, the choice for
  internal or external capabilities involves trust, relationships,
  personal beliefs and aspirations.
\item
  \emph{Identification theory}: Individuals derive value and meaning
  from group membership. This can impact the involvement of external
  actors for IT projects in a negative way.
\end{itemize}

\citet[16-17]{nevo2007} concludes that his research supports the
transaction cost hypothesis: ``when the internal IT capability is weak,
developing and implementing an IT solution is likely to cost more
compared with hiring external IT consultants to do the same job.''
Furthermore, the reverse situation also supports the identification
theory: ``IT consultants will not receive the legitimacy they require
{[}\ldots{]} if their knowledge and expertise do not differ from that
possessed by the in-house IT team. Under these circumstances, external
IT consultants' impact on IT productivity is expected to be lower.''

Nevertheless, there is a serious limitation in the work of
\citet{nevo2007}. An IT project is assumed to be fixed in time, with
fixed parameters. It does not account for ``vendor learning''
\citep{wu2004} during the project. \citet{cha2009} tackles this
shortcoming with a model built around two parameters:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  (production) knowledge transfer rate: the ability of the client to
  capture knowledge from the vendor.
\item
  (coordination) knowledge depreciation rate: the ability of the client
  to retain coordination knowledge as it outsources IT activities.
\end{enumerate}

They conclude that firms with a low production knowledge transfer rate
(e.g.~unmotivated employees) should insource or outsource all their IT
capabilities. When they also have a high coordination knowledge
deprecation rate (e.g.~bad project management), insourcing is the only
option. On the other hand, when both the production knowledge transfer
and coordination knowledge depreciation rate are high, the optimal rate
of of IT outsourcing is also high.

\hypertarget{problem-statement}{%
\section{Problem statement}\label{problem-statement}}

According to \citet[357]{ang2004}, the legal interpretation of an IT
outsourcing contract is too limited. Instead, they claim that the
construct of a \emph{psychological contract} is more appropriate for
analyzing the relationship between an IT service supplier and customer.
The strength of psychological contract theory is threefold:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  it focuses on mutual obligations;
\item
  the emphasis is on psychological obligations;
\item
  the emphasis is on the individual level--not on the organizations as
  parties of the contract.
\end{enumerate}

Consequently, the psychological contract not only comprises the legal
contract, but also the unwritten promises, interpersonal relations, and
the individual interpretations and perceptions. Since consultancy
contracts can become extremely complex (with project descriptions going
into the ten thousands of words), and the involved parties entangled in
multiple ways, these intangible aspects can gain prominence. The
research in \citet[369-70]{ang2004} outlines several psychological
contract obligations that positively impact the success of an outsourced
IT project.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On the supplier side: (1) clear authority structures, (2) knowledge
  transfer by educating the customer, (3) building inter-organizational
  teams.
\item
  On the customer side: (1) clear specification of requirements, (2)
  prompt payment, and (3) project ownership and monitoring.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{research-questions}{%
\section{Research Questions}\label{research-questions}}

Novel research is feasible for drawing conclusions regarding the
\emph{raison d'être} of IT consultants with regards to knowledge
transfer between IT consultants and their principals.

Given these observations, I propose the following research questions.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  How successful is knowledge transfer between IT implementation
  consultants and internal employees at corporations with regards to
  adoption and implementation of IT solutions? (Methodology:
  Quantitative such as surveys)
\item
  What factors have a positive impact on knowledge transfer between IT
  implementation consultants and internal employees of corporations?
  (Methodology: Qualitative research such as deep interviews and focus
  groups)
\end{enumerate}

The most relevant outcome of this research could be a set of
recommendations, or a framework for maximizing knowledge transfer in the
described setting.
