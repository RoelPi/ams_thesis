Traditionally, management consultancy came in the form of strategic advice. However, over the past decades, the business world has witnessed that organizations increasingly focus on their core business, while outsourcing everything else to a third party or a "contingent workforce": consultants and freelancers [@msp2022]. This practice has even penetrated organizations' core value chain, a phenomenon known as business process outsourcing or BPO [@shi1]. However, working with a contingent workforce, entails considerable risk.

# State of the literature

## What is IT consultancy?
Defining IT consultancy is no easy task. Over the past decades, their possible roles and variety of responsibilities have expanded drastically. @swanson2010 [20-25] has described five different ways how consultants can contribute to an organization's innovation process through IT.

* *Business strategy*: IT consultancy can lead the organization to new pursuits and technologies they wouldn't have discovered themselves. Second, IT consultancy can frame the need for innovation in strategic terms, and they prepare and legitimize the need for change.
* *Technology assessment*: IT consultancy can facilitate the comprehension of IT technologies and its alternatives.
* *Business process improvement*: Innovations that involve IT usually come to fruition only after business processes have been revamped. Business process changes usually require an outside-in view and offer rich opportunities for consulting.
* *Systems integration*: In many cases, introducing a new technology requires that it needs to be integrated with existing systems and users need to be onboarded. This type of IT consultancy usually requires coding skills, hands-on design and implementation expertise
* *Business support services*: Finally, once the implementation is completed, it can take a while before the solution is entirely assimilated. IT consultants can provide complementary IT services such as support and maintenance until the technology is entirely embedded in the organization.

## Why IT Consultancy?

@nevo2007 [8-10] outlines five theoretical frameworks that contribute to the question why firms should (not) utilize external IT capabilities.
* The *resource-based view* (RBV) claims that firms can earn sustainable above-normal returns by possessing rare and valuable resources and that they have isolating mechanisms that prevent the dissemination of those resources. <<This needs to be investigated further how this relates to consulting >>
* The *micro-economic* view assumes that firms operate in fully competitive markets and, contrary to RBV, that above-normal returns are competed away by rivals or new entrants. Utilizing IT and external capabilities is simply a matter of delivering the optimal quantity of products and their prices.
* *Transaction cost economics* claims that firms are interested in identifying areas in which they can outperform market-based interactions and do themselves. The commodity-like nature of IT solutions make them very prone to being outsourced to consultants.
* *Institutional theory* does not reject the microeconomic theory that firms try to make rational choices, but acknowledges that there are cognitive and rational constraints. Consequently, the choice for internal or external capabilities involves trust, relationships, personal beliefs and aspirations.
* *Identification theory*: Individuals derive value and meaning from group membership. This can impact the involvement of external actors for IT projects in a negative way.

## Management Consultancy

There is already a fair amount of research with regards to management consultancy (i.e. in the narrow sense of the term, meaning "strategic business advice") that describes why consultants exist [@canback1998; @sturdy2009] and how they operate [@clark1998; @bessant1995; @whittle2006]. Central in this literature is the diffusion and transferring of knowledge. @canback1999 summarizes it neatly by stating that "external consultants have a wider knowledge base than their internal counterparts, having worked with more clients and in a wider range of industries. Having seen similar problems before, the cost of leveraging this knowledge base is lower for external consultants." Despite this body of literature on management consultancy, research that focuses on IT-related consultancy is fairly scarce [@bloomfield1995; @nevo2007; @swanson2010].

## Knowledge transfer

There is substantial research on knowledge management (as a multidisciplinary discipline within the field of information science) and knowledge transfer (as a broad topic within the discipline). Furthermore, there seems to be some academic interest in knowledge transfer in a principal-agent context [@ning2008; @haines2003], as is the case with between an organization and their contingent workforce. This research could be key in steering and narrowing the scope of the research.

# Problem statement

An important risk is the **lack of knowledge transfer** from the consultant to the hiring organization, especially in the case of complex IT implementations. Why? When complex digital ecosystems are rolled out in an organization, several factors determine the success of the outcome. Not only should IT & business strategies be aligned, and should the solution be thoroughly adopted by business departments. Equally important is how the IT department succeeds in developing and absorbing knowledge about the solution and how it is embedded in the organization. A lack of knowledge transfer between the contingent workforce and the principal can results in a lack of understanding of the solution's capabilities and applications. Several **negative externalities** can arise:

-   inadequate support towards business users;
-   incomplete maintenance with second-degree externalities such as risks for availability and security;
-   over time, a capability overlap with other tools in the organization's tool stack can develop.

There are many **causes for knowledge transfer to (partially) fail**:

-   The consultant simply does not have the required knowledge.
-   The consultant tries to lock in their client by not transferring all the required knowledge.
-   The organization (or the manager, or the hiring department) does not explicitly expect to extract knowledge from the consultant, but simply considers them to be a "contingent workforce" in its minimalist interpretation.
-   There are no adequate procedures, rituals and tools in place within the organization for facilitating the knowledge transfer.


# Research Questions

Novel research is feasible for drawing conclusions regarding the *raison d'Ãªtre* of IT consultants with regards to knowledge transfer between IT consultants and their principals.

Given these observations, I propose the following research questions.

1.  How successful is knowledge transfer between IT implementation consultants and internal employees at corporations with regards to adoption and implementation of IT solutions? (Methodology: Quantitative such as surveys)

2.  What factors have a positive impact on knowledge transfer between IT implementation consultants and internal employees of corporations? (Methodology: Qualitative research such as deep interviews and focus groups)

The most relevant outcome of this research could be a set of recommendations, or a framework for maximizing knowledge transfer in the described setting.
