abstract = {The business case for hiring external IT consultants is compelling. Consultants can represent a rich source of valuable, short-term capabilities. From a resource-based perspective, however, the fungible nature of these capabilities argues against their long-term strategic value. Furthermore, IT consultants may be at odds with existing internal capabilities. Institutional theory suggests that external consultants may not share the same norms and beliefs held by the internal staff and consequently their efforts in achieving organizational goals may be diluted or compromised. This paper explores the tension between internal and external IT capabilities on the realization of enhanced IT productivity. Drawing on telephone survey data on the adoption of Internet business solutions, the results of the study show that firms see tangible benefits from using external IT consultants, but these benefits are moderated by the level of existing internal IT capabilities.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper explores the role of management consultants in the development of information technology (IT) in organizations. Contending that the process of IT systems development is characterized by the exercise of power, the central theme of the argument concerns the indissoluble nature of the technical and socio-political skills inherent in IT consultancy practice. IT consultancy practice is not just socio-political when winning a contract - the sales pitch - and technical when developing an IT system. Rather, socio-political skills centred on the mobilization of discursive and symbolic resources are an inherent part of the construction of such systems.},
